  pure: false  // By default, Angular pipes are pure, meaning they only re-run when the input changes (immutable data). 
  // Setting pure: false makes this pipe impure, meaning it will re-run every time the component changes, regardless of whether the input changes. This might be useful for sorting dynamic data where changes happen frequently.
